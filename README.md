# "Portfolio Fax Machine" Google Apps Script
An apps script that lets instructors copy folders and Google Drive docs/slides/sheets directly to learners' portfolios. (I use this in my teaching and learning program to make it easier for learners to update and collaborate on shared documents during workshops and discussions.)

Please see the [project wiki overview](https://github.com/NMSalmon/Portfolio-Fax-Machine/wiki/Using-the-Portfolio-Fax-Machine) for context and adaptation information. This overview shows how the script connects to a Google sheet template. 

For the apps script on its own, see this page: [Portfolio Fax Machine v.1](https://github.com/NMSalmon/Portfolio_Fax_Machine_Google_Apps_Script/blob/main/Apps%20Script%20v1)
