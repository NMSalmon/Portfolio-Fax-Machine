# "Portfolio Fax Machine" Google Apps Script
An apps script that lets instructors copy folders and Google Drive docs/slides/sheets directly to learners' portfolios. (I use this in my teaching and learning program to make it easier for learners to update and collaborate on shared documents during workshops and discussions.)
